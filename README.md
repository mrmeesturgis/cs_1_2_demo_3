## cs_1_2_demo_3

This is a demo that explores how to use regular expressions. It also has a notebook that explores probability using [matplotlib.](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/quick_start.html)

You will have to [download matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) if you want to play around with it. It is pretty cool though. More on that in the near future.  

You'll note that I also import numpy, but that's not necessary at the moment. You can download it if you want, but certainly don't have to.
