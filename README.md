This is a demo that explores how to use regular expressions. It also has a notebook that explores probability using [matplotlib.](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/quick_start.html)

You will have to download matplotlib if you want to play around with it. It is pretty cool though. More on that in the near future.
